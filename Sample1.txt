To address these challenges, we propose an AI-driven autonomous test automation framework that eliminates the need for manual scripting. This solution leverages Agentic AI to generate executable test scripts from plain English descriptions, enabling seamless automation for UI and API testing. The AI dynamically executes tests, analyzes results, and identifies failures, reducing the need for human intervention. Additionally, it incorporates self-healing capabilities to detect and fix broken locators, adjust assertions, and retry failed test cases automatically. By integrating with CI/CD pipelines, this approach ensures faster execution, adaptive test selection, and reduced maintenance overhead, making test automation more efficient, scalable, and reliable.
