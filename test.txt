Confluence Page: Network Interaction Tracker Utility
Overview
The Network Interaction Tracker Utility is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the tracking and analysis of user interactions with web applications. This utility operates as a zip solution, containing a batch file (bat file) that, when executed, launches a controlled environment in a new browser. It intercepts network layer activities, capturing essential details such as URL, method, request headers, request body, and response body. The collected data can be exported to an Excel file and seamlessly used to create Postman collections, providing a comprehensive solution for tracking and reproducing user interactions.

Features
1. Browser Launch in Controlled Environment
Description: The utility launches a new browser instance within a controlled environment to ensure the accurate and secure tracking of user interactions.
Benefit: Guarantees the consistency and reliability of captured data by mitigating external factors.
2. Network Layer Interception  
Description: Intercepts and records network layer activities, capturing crucial information such as URL, method, request headers, request body, and response body.
Benefit: Enables in-depth analysis of user interactions and provides insights into application behavior.
3. Excel Output Generation
Description: Generates an Excel file containing detailed information about the intercepted network calls.
Benefit: Facilitates easy sharing and analysis of data, supporting collaboration among teams.
4. Postman Collection Creation
Description: Allows the direct utilization of captured request payloads to create Postman collections.
Benefit: Streamlines the process of creating and testing API requests based on real user interactions.
5. Production Management Team Support
Description: The utility is designed to be user-friendly, enabling the production management team to navigate critical business scenarios.
Benefit: Empowers non-technical users to gather essential data for analysis without the need for extensive technical knowledge.
6. Seamless Data Handover to Technical Team
Description: Enables the production management team to pass on captured data to the core technical team for in-depth analysis.
Benefit: Facilitates efficient communication and collaboration between non-technical and technical teams.
7. Future Automation Integration with Spartan
Description: The utility is designed with extensibility in mind, with plans to extend the capability to record network calls into automation scripts, specifically those used by Spartan.
Benefit: Enhances the automation testing process by incorporating real user interactions into test scenarios.
