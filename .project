I want to extend my sincere appreciation for your outstanding contributions to the Data Let Innovation initiative, which focuses on AI. Your work across various aspects has been crucial to the success of this initiative.

In addition to your excellent coordination of events such as the kiosk and "Let's Talk About AI" sessions, your role as a mentor for the Mumbai location has been highly valuable. Moreover, your involvement as a trainer for the Leader in ??? further highlights your dedication. Your efforts in managing email communications and maintaining the AI Confluence page have also been pivotal in ensuring smooth collaboration and information flow.

Your commitment and leadership have made a significant impact, and I look forward to more opportunities to collaborate with you.
